/**
 * The SQLSync Generator DSL for JavaScript is implemented entirely through
 * structured JSDoc-style comment blocks. There is no helper code to
 * include in your project.
 *
 * Please refer to the documentation in /Docs/javascript/readme.md for the
 * correct comment syntax and usage examples.
 *
 * Example of a class-level JSDoc block:
 * /**
 *  * @ExportToSQL
 *  * @tableName user_profiles
 *  * @schemaName users
 *  *\/
 *
 * Example of a property-level JSDoc block:
 * /**
 *  * @SqlColumn isPrimaryKey=true type=INT
 *  *\/
